<h1>Using N-ary Associations</h1>

<p>
	The GSN plug-in allows the user to create n-ary associations between the elements of the diagram.
	The same constraints apply for the standard associations and their n-ary variants.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>In order to create an n-ary association, you first have to create a standard association
		of the desired type (IncontextOf or SupportedBy).</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>You will be able to add more branches to the association by selecting the n-ary variant
		of the selected association (N-aryIncontextOf or N-arySupportedBy) in the Palette and drawing
		an association starting anywhere along the line of the previous association.</p>
