<h1>Using the patterns library</h1>

<p>
	The GSN plug-in includes a library of generic patterns drawn from the literature.
	These patterns can be imported in your safety argument diagrams.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Patterns can be imported by right-clicking on the root of your model on the "Model Explorer" view,
		and then selecting the "Imported Registered Package" action from the "Import" menu.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>You will then be greeted by a dialog window allowing you to select which pattern(s) you would like
		to import into your diagram.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In order to import a loaded pattern into your diagram, you have to select all the children 
		of the package named after the loaded pattern in the model explorer, and drag & drop them into
		you model.</p>

	<li>
		<p>The imported pattern will certainly look untidy. In order to rearrange the nodes, select the "Arrange All" 
		action from the "Arrange Actions" menu of the toolbar.</p>
